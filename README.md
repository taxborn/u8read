# :eyeglasses: u8read - UTF-8 file reader
This is just small project as I learn C and lower-level programming.

## Building
Just a simple `make` command will create the executable in the `build/` directiory.

## Running
```
./build/u8read read.txt
```
Or you can replace **read.txt** with whatever other file. This will now emit the UTF-8 codepoints.
